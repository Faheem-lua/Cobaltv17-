##About the build/ Folder and build.log File

The build/ directory is an essential part of the development environment, serving as the dedicated space where compiled outputs, generated runtime files, temporary resources, and structured artifacts are stored during the build process of the project. This folder ensures that raw source code remains clean and unaffected by transient files, while providing a central location for tools and scripts to access compiled assets or deploy-ready binaries.

Within the build/ folder, developers can expect to find various outputs depending on the build configuration — such as debug binaries, release builds, bundled scripts, minified assets, or deployment packages — depending on the complexity of the pipeline and whether it's used for scripting environments like Lua, native application development, or hybrid game engines.

Alongside this directory, the build.log file acts as a chronological and structured log that records the detailed output of every build session. It includes timestamps, warnings, errors, command executions, dependency resolutions, and any messages generated by the build scripts or compilers. This log is instrumental in diagnosing failures, verifying successful builds, and maintaining consistency across development environments.

To maintain clarity and prevent unnecessary version control clutter, both the build/ folder and build.log are commonly excluded via .gitignore files or other ignore rules in VCS platforms like Git. This ensures that only relevant source files, configuration, and scripts are tracked, while dynamic and temporary files generated during compilation or execution remain local and disposable.
